# Changelog

### 25 April, 2020
* Introduces GriefPrevention
    * GriefPrevention directions are given to players on connect.
    * Players start with 500 blocks by default and earn 100 extra every hour they've played (this accounts for idling)

* Started sending notifications through the join message
   * I will maintain a list of these messages as they change here.
